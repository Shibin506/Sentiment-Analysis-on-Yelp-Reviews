The food was absolutely amazing and the service was great!
Worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time.
It was okay, nothing special.
Super friendly staff and delicious drinks.
Too expensive for the quality provided.
Best sushi place in town!
Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Great ambiance and fast service!
Meh, not bad but not great either.
Totally loved the dessert!
